# About
My friend is a vacuum tube fanatic, so we decided to build a modular synthesizer based on [Yves Usson's project](https://yusynth.net/Modular/index_en.html). As manufacturing of PCBs in China is enormously cheap and trivial in comparison to itching the board in your basement by yourself, we decided to recreate the project in KiCAD and share it with the World.
